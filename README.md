## Setup!

- run `npm install` or `yarn` to install project dependecies

localhost:3000

## Approach

Components are breaking down based on reusability e.g header, Footer, layout which can  be found  in the shared folder. Since this is just a single UI I combine the components in the index.jsx to build the landing page and optimize for responsiveness accross  different screens.


## Status

This is a coding challenge for Frontend Role at Exx Network.
